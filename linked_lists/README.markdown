## Linked Lists

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures.

### Singly-Linked List

Implement a singly-linked list using:

* A) Iteration/looping
* B) Recursion

### Doubly-Linked List

In a doubly-linked list, each node has a link to both the previous and next nodes in the list.

### Ring List

In a circular or ring list, the "last" node links back to the first. How does this structure affect searching?
